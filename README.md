# valueChase
> Creates a value chase incorporating an ease and friction.

This module creates a chase between a provided value and target value.
For example, if you had a dot follow every mouse click on a page, animating 
against the output of this module allows us to have the dot move to our 
current location gradually rather than immediately jumping to it. And if we 
move the mouse while it's traveling to its target, it will correct course 
smoothly.

User-defined friction, ease, and specificity (tolerance) requirements allow 
you to control how quickly and aggressively a value chases its target.

This module is a trait more than a class, and is meant to be augmented by other 
modules such as `pointer-chase` and `scroll-chase`. It extends EventEmitter, and 
broadcasts progress towards reaching its target.

Basic [demo](https://kettle-utils.s3.amazonaws.com/value-chase/index.html).

## Installation
Install via npm:

```sh
$ npm i value-chase
```

## Usage
```javascript
const ValueChase = require('value-chase');
const valueChase = new ValueChase();

valueChase.on('render', evt => {
  console.log(evt.progress);
});

valueChase.start();

window.setTimeout(() => {
  valueChase.setProgress(100);
}, 1000);
```

## Methods

Methods that accept parameters always expect numeric values.

| method | description |
|---|---|
| `ValueChase.destroy()` | Stops the module, removes all listeners, destroys its internal `ticker-js` instance, and broadcasts the `destroyed` event. |
| `ValueChase.start()` | Starts the internal `ticker-js` instance and begins calculating the current value. |
| `ValueChase.stop()` | Stops the internal `ticker-js` instance and pauses calculating current value. Also stops all events from being emitted. |
| `ValueChase.isRunning()` | Whether or not the instance is currently stopped. |
| `ValueChase.setValue(number)` | Immediately jump to the provided value and force a render. |
| `ValueChase.setProgress(number)` | This is how we pass a target value to the motion curve calculator. This is often what needs to be overwritten if you have coordinate or vector values to update. |
| `ValueChase.setFriction(number)` | Set friction used by calculator. |
| `ValueChase.setTolerance(number)` | Set the specificity requirements necessary to indicate when value has reached target. |


## Events

This module emits `update` and `render` events. All calculations and 
measurements should occur on update, and the actual rendering of those 
measurements within the DOM should occur on render.

For example, if we want to have an object slide horizontally as we scroll 
vertically, determining the x-axis transform based on a value should be done 
on update. Actually applying the transform via a style tag is done on render.

| event | description |
|---|---|
| `render` | Apply DOM transformations / animations |
| `update` | Calculate any necessary animation values |
